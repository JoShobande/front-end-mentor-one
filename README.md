## Overview

  ### The challenge

    Users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

  ### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I started to learn how to use semantic HTML more efficiently rather than 'throwing' div tags everywhere. Searching or researching for the best tags to use is not something i usually do, but in this project, i paid attention to using the best tags for the job and i will start to apply this to other projects i work on moving forward.
I also never really learnt the BEM method of naming my CSS classes so i started to learn that and be more concious is making sure my CSS classes are named according to the BEM standard and are readable.
I encountered a chaallenge in one of the sections. i name it statistcs. i had a chanllenge with aliging the little images with the number text below it. i solved it by giving it a margin right. there is probably a clearner solution to this but well, for now, that's the solution i used.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- In the code below, i used the figure tag to wrap the img tag, before now, i have never used the figure tag so i am proud of my self :) -->
<Section class="statistics">
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/images/screen-mockups.svg" />
            </figure>
            <div class="statistics_figures">
                <img src="assets/images/icon-communities.svg"/>
                <p>1.4K+ <br/><span>commuminties formed</span> </p>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <br/>

        </Section> 
```
```css
/* this code was to make a text wraped in a span tag go to the next line. the default display on the span tage is inline.  */
.statistics_figures p span{
    display: block;
}

```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
